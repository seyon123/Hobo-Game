# Hobo-Game
A hobo game created for a university project.

Game is available to play at https://TrevorClarke.ca/projects/hoboGame

## Contributions:

Trevor:
- Contributed to the integration of Printer.js.
- Helped develop all aspects of the Hobo game’s classes and functions.
- Created and modified the image assets used in the game. These include the animated hobo images, the grass images, the cobblestone, the wooden planks, the darkness gradient, etc
- Researched methods of creating darkness in the scene, determined that changing the blending mode would be the easiest way of adding the time / day features.
- Researched how to add light sources around the players
- Researched how to make cone-shaped light sources to be used on the front of the train
- Researched how to add precipitation to the game. This was interesting due to the top-down view that the game possessed.
- Assisted with the calculations of the theoretical analysis’ in the Results Report.
- Structured, formatted and contributed to the content in the Results Report.
- Generated and executed many tests outlined in the Test Report.
- Documented and recorded defects throughout the development process.
- Outlined and described the assumed engineering tasks associated with the user stories.
- Assisted with the documentation of the Product Backlog as the various tasks were completed.

Seyon:
- Contributed and helped develop code and functionality for the game
- Added functionality to the game that added images to be displayed
- Helped with some of the logical components of the game.
- Helped create some of the visuals for the game
- Found some of the sound to be used in the game
- Helped with writing up the test report and results report
- Helped with testing some of the functionality of the code
- Created some of the User stories and effort estimates and sprint details for the product backlog
- Researched how to do product backlog, Test report, and results report
- Helped format and structure the content in deliverable

Jacky:
- Contributed to the development of the hobo and train logic of the game
- Helped with the creation and integration of the classes and functions
- Tested and recorded some of the experimental analysis results in the Results Report
- Assisted with the Test Cases and Defects in the Test Report
- Generated user stories in the Product Backlog
- Helped with finding solutions to various bugs and logic issues in the game
- Assisted with the integration of game assets and game mechanics
- Researched ways to implement the engineering tasks required for the game
- Formatted and contributed to the content of Product Backlog, Test Report, and Results Report

Hamdan:
- Contributed to Test Report Document. 
- Specifically coming up with test cases and executing them while recording findings.
- Contributed to the Defect report, detailing errors in-game and writing steps to replicate and resolve issues in full detail.
- Created an effective hobo movement function and contributed to various other functions within the Hobo class.
- Assisted with the logic of game mechanics in source code. This includes train movement, collisions, and player damage.
- Ensured game validation by making sure it met requirements.
- Assisted with Product backlog by figuring out Engineering Tasks from User stories.
- Work on refactoring various functions within the Main and Helper files.

Jawwad: 
- Created and Formatted Product Backlog
- Assisted in creating calculations associated with the theoretical analysis’ in the Results report
- Provided experimental data used in conjunction with theoretical estimations in the Results report
- Contributed towards documentation of test cases along with structuring and format in the Test Report.
- Assisted with execution of tests highlighted in Test Report
- Assisted in generating user stories, creating effort estimates and documenting sprint details  in the Product Backlog
- Assisted in developing train logic and the random generation of player names
- Researched formatting of Test Report, Results Report and product backlog
- Verified and validated whether the final game product met the requirements required by user stories and engineering tasks
